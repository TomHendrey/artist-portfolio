                                    On July 15, 1965, NASA&apos;s Mariner 4 transmitted the first
                                    close-up images of Mars from approximately 10,500 miles away.
                                    The spacecraft sent data back to Earth over 8.5 hours as a
                                    series of binary numbers representing brightness values across a
                                    200-pixel grid. At JPL, engineers couldn&apos;t wait for
                                    official photographic processing. Instead, they hand-coloured a
                                    printout of the raw numerical data, using pencils to shade
                                    squares according to the transmitted values. Engineers with
                                    pencils, translating numbers into a visible landscape. This act
                                    revealed Mars as a cratered, moon-like surface.

                                    transformation of invisible information into visible form. Data
                                    is collected through instruments, transmitted across vast
                                    distances as electromagnetic signals, converted into numerical
                                    values, processed, and finally displayed as images we can
                                    comprehend. Each stage is a translation between different states
                                    of information.

                                    This process is inherently imperfect. Signals degrade across
                                    distance, introducing noise and distortion. Bandwidth
                                    limitations compress and pixelate. Transmission errors create
                                    artifacts. Yet these imperfections have become a language of
                                    their own. Scan lines, compression artifacts, colour shifts, and
                                    digital noise are not simply failures but signatures of the
                                    technological process itself. They tell us not just what we are
                                    seeing, but how we are seeing it.

                                    are already many steps removed from their source. Each painting

                                    required to make it visible.

                                    traditional practice as petty, limited and irrelevant to
                                    contemporary mores and practice. It ignores its dependency and
                                    moral contingency on these modes, denying their potency and
                                    rendering them illegible.

                                    The dynamic is something of the elephant in the gallery where
                                    contemporary artists downplay or overstate the role and
                                    implications of tech, suggesting that their work is dissolvable
                                    from its context or the present reality of human consciousness.

                                    In this collaboration between Tom Hendrey and myself - Kendall
                                    White - we have explored this dynamic through genre, examining
                                    how tech at once connects and detaches us from perception and
                                    action, how the traditional notions of place and practice are
                                    altered by data culture and digital tools, and what the abstract
                                    implications are and the demands these must transfer to the
                                    practice of painting.

                            We are all obliged to engage with our reality - but the nature of that
                            reality is increasingly defined in detachment from us - it is reported
                            to us outside of our faculties and experiences. our navigation of that
                            reality - our activities of every kind, are mediated by the same data
                            systems and digital tools…

                            Tech at once enables and connects but it is equally a detaching force
                            that negates our faculties, denudes our lives of immaterial notions. We
                            are conflicted about its desirability or indeed capability. the general
                            embrace of tech is not reflected in art. Traditional modes of art are
                            increasingly technophobic.

                            When we approach genre painting - that is work that explore &apos;human
                            centric reality&apos;, it has become a ritual act - self referential
                            field increasingly irrelevant to its actors and audiences. The choice of
                            painting demands the direct use of an individual faculties: that is the
                            result will be a reflection of their conciousness, there sense
                            perception, their active capabilities.

                            implications in a painting that go beyond the content - a painting is
                            hallowed object between artefact and relic. The content is a coherent
                            act where gesture, materiality, scale composition etc discribe something
                            from the creator themselves - a perception characterised by their
                            nature, their presence in reality.

                            But how can this be contemporarily relevant or conceptually valid when

                            active. And the traditional critical qualities of the treatment of
                            content (dramatisation, characterisation, personification) as relative
                            to the authors nature is impossible when detached from their

                            as data expression as interface, format resolution,(the manner in which
                            they are present in our reality) - hence portrait format, between data

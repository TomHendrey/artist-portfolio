                                    We are all obliged to engage with our reality - but the nature
                                    of that reality is increasingly defined in detachment from us -
                                    it is reported to us outside of our faculties and experiences.
                                    our navigation of that reality - our activities of every kind,
                                    are mediated by the same data systems and digital tools…
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Tech at once enables and connects but it is equally a detaching
                                    force that negates our faculties, denudes our lives of
                                    immaterial notions. We are conflicted about its desirability or
                                    indeed capability. the general embrace of tech is not reflected
                                    in art. Traditional modes of art are increasingly technophobic.

                                    When we approach genre painting - that is work that explore
                                    ‘human centric reality’, it has become a ritual act - self
                                    referential field increasingly irrelevant to its actors and
                                    audiences. The choice of painting demands the direct use of an
                                    individual faculties: that is the result will be a reflection of
                                    their conciousness, there sense perception, their active
                                    capabilities.

                                    This mode is believed to make present psychological and
                                    metaphysical implications in a painting that go beyond the
                                    content - a painting is hallowed object between artefact and
                                    relic. The content is a coherent act where gesture, materiality,
                                    scale composition etc discribe something from the creator
                                    themselves - a perception characterised by their nature, their
                                    presence in reality.{" "}

                                    But how can this be contemporarily relevant or conceptually
                                    valid when it is a negation of the creators technological
                                    nature?{" "}

                                    The choice to use primitive traditional means denies the role,
                                    presence and implications of tech in contempary humanity -
                                    cognitive, perceptual, active. And the traditional critical
                                    qualities of the treatment of content (dramatisation,
                                    characterisation, personification) as relative to the authors
                                    nature is impossible when detached from their technological
                                    condition…

                                    We have not painted landscapes - these are not inhabitable
                                    spaces anyone has ever been - do we accept them as place or as
                                    their manifest reality as data expression as interface, format
                                    resolution,(the manner in which they are present in our reality)
                                    - hence portrait format, between data map and image.

                                    Production is in the manner that reflects the integration of
                                    data system and digital tools in our lives - their nature the
                                    role of these means in contempary thought, perception, action.

                                    These works explored these themes of detachment and connection,
                                    the conflict between the tacit organic & immeasurable and the
                                    disinterested, data driven and precise nature of computational
                                    media and means. They try and show the present reality of
                                    contemporary people between the traditional and its concerns and
                                    the technological and its values an implications.

                                <p>How do we regard these works - landscape?</p>
                                <p>
                                    In using technological mens are we allowing the moral force of
                                    the content contained - acknowledging these as place and and
                                    landscape, the changing face of humanity, or are these works a
                                    subversion of the moral force of painting.
